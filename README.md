# Pad controller PCB

This PCB will be located on our static fire test stand. It will be responsibe for controlling the ignition and fuel systems.

Make sure to clone submodules when cloning this repository.

## TODO
- Increase hole size on the Feather's pads. The hole size on KiCad's default Feather footprint was too small for male headers on my previous PCB designs. The defualt size might be ok for female headers though.
- Confirm which MOSFET model we will be using for the ignitor.
- Clean up the schematic.
- Finalize the layout and routing.
- Filet the corners of the board.
